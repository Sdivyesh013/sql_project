# sql_project
In this project i first cleaned the data sets in excel and then imported it in mysql and then confirmed all the data types are as per the values in the columns.
next was to identify the KPIs that i need to prepare, as it was a data set related to bank i thought of using kpis such as yoy, ytd,mtd,mom, average increase in customer count and and joins also to fetch data from both the tables and much more.
I have upoladed the file for better understanding of the queries and the respective KPIs that they generate.
